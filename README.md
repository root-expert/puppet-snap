## Module Description

This module installs Snap and `core` snap package. Also it provides a package provider, named `snap`, which uses
the [Snapd REST API](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapd-api) for managing snaps.

## Setup

## What Snap Affects

* the snapd package
* the core snap package
* the snapd daemon

## Beginning with snap

To install Snap and the core package:

```puppet
include snap
```

If you are using a RedHat family OS you need to additionally install [puppet-epel](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-epel)
module or manage the EPEL repository on your own.

If you don't want puppet-snap to manage EPEL:

```puppet
class { 'snap':
  manage_repo => false,
}
```

## Usage

This module also provides a package provider for installing and managing snaps.

To install a snap:

```puppet
package { 'hello-world':
  ensure   => installed,
  provider => 'snap',
}
```

To uninstall a snap:

```puppet
package { 'hello-world':
  ensure   => absent,
  provider => 'snap',
}
```

To purge a snap (_warning purging will remove all snap data_):

```puppet
package { 'hello-world':
  ensure   => purged,
  provider => 'snap',
}
```

To install from specific channel:

```puppet
package { 'hello-world':
  ensure   => 'beta',
  provider => 'snap',
}
```

If you want to install a snap in classic mode:

```puppet
package { 'hello-world':
  ensure          => installed,
  provider        => 'snap',
  install_options => ['classic'],
}
```

Same applies for options `jailmode` and `devmode`
